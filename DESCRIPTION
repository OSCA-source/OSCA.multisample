Description: 
    Deploys the multi-sample analysis chapters for the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This describes the handling of multiple samples in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis, 
    starting with integration of multiple datasets into a common space for consistent analyses,
    differential expression comparisons between conditions based on pseudo-bulk samples,
    and differential abundance analyses for cell subpopulations.
    It is intended for readers who are already familiar with basic single-cell analyses, possibly after reading some of the prior books in this collection.
